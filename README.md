## React Bootcamp

Here you will find a simple application called My Todo List.
 
 As the name says, this application will handle a list of tasks where for each task we will be able to create, delete and mark as completed.

Currently, the code is all on the App.js file. No logic implemented, only layout.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
